  Users can control the snake movement. The snake moves forward with the straight direction as a default. With controlling the snake's movement, a user can gain some points by eating apples. When an apple is just consumed, a new apple will be created in the random location on the world. When the head is colliding into the wall, the snake will die. When the head is colliding into its body(tail), it will lose some points and it will lose some part of its body.
